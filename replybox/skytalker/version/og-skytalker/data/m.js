        text: "Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun and the smallest in our solar system, with a diameter of about 4,880 kilometers. It has a very thin atmosphere, composed mainly of oxygen, sodium, and hydrogen, which makes it unable to retain heat, causing extreme temperature fluctuations. Mercury’s surface is heavily cratered, similar to the Moon, due to a lack of an atmosphere to protect it from impacts. A year on Mercury, or one full orbit around the Sun, lasts just 88 Earth days, while a day on Mercury (one full rotation) is about 59 Earth days. Despite its proximity to the Sun, Mercury has no moons, and its surface experiences temperatures ranging from extremely hot (up to 430°C) during the day to freezing cold (-180°C) at night.",

        text: "Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and is often referred to as the 'Red Planet' due to its reddish appearance, caused by iron oxide (rust) on its surface. It has a diameter of about 6,779 kilometers and is home to the tallest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons, and a massive canyon, Valles Marineris. Mars has a thin atmosphere composed mostly of carbon dioxide, with traces of nitrogen and argon, and experiences extreme temperatures ranging from -125°C to 20°C. It has two small moons, Phobos and Deimos, and evidence suggests that liquid water once existed on its surface in the distant past. Mars is a prime target for exploration, with missions seeking to determine its potential for past or present life.",
