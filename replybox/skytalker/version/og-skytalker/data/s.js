        text:"Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the solar system, with a diameter of about 116,460 kilometers. It is a gas giant primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, similar to Jupiter, and is best known for its stunning system of rings made up of ice particles, rock debris, and dust. Saturn's atmosphere is mostly hydrogen, with helium and traces of other gases, and features strong winds, storms, and a hexagonal cloud pattern at its north pole. The planet has over 80 known moons, including Titan, the second-largest moon in the solar system, which is larger than the planet Mercury and has a thick atmosphere, possibly containing liquid methane lakes. Saturn's low density means it could float in water, as it is mostly made of lighter elements like hydrogen and helium. The planet's beauty, along with its many moons and complex ring system, makes it one of the most studied planets in the solar system.",
