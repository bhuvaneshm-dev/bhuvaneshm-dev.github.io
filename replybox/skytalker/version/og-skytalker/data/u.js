        text:"Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun and the third-largest in the solar system, with a diameter of about 50,724 kilometers. It is an ice giant composed primarily of hydrogen, helium, and ices such as water, ammonia, and methane, which gives it a pale blue color. Uranus is unique among the planets because it has an extreme axial tilt of about 98 degrees, meaning it essentially orbits the Sun on its side, with its poles facing directly toward the Sun at different points in its orbit. This unusual tilt leads to extreme seasonal variations, with each pole experiencing 42 years of continuous daylight followed by 42 years of darkness. Uranus has a faint ring system and 27 known moons, with Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, and Oberon being the largest. The planet's atmosphere features strong winds and large storm systems, and its cold interior generates more heat than it receives from the Sun. Uranus remains one of the least explored planets, with only one spacecraft, Voyager 2, having visited it during a flyby in 1986.",
